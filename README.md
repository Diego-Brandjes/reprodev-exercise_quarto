The goal of this repository is to create a reproducible research compendium. The compendium was generated by [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com) as part of the course [Reproducible Programming and Development](https://mlarpis.github.io/reprodev).

Use ever which way you like to use it. 

The rendered `Quarto` file can be found [here](/doc/reprodev-exercise_quarto.html)
